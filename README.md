# Simple RAG Example

This repository is for learning how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using:

- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) â€“ framework for orchestration  
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) â€“ embeddings (`BAAI/bge-m3`)  
- [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) â€“ PostgreSQL vector store  
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) â€“ LLMs for answering queries  
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) â€“ fast Python package manager

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kobeieii/rag101.git
cd rag101
```

### 2. Install dependencies (with uv)
```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup PostgreSQL with pgvector
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will start PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension, and automatically create a `documents` table.

### 4. Start Ollama (if using locally)
You can choose and pull any model listed on the [Ollama models page](https://ollama.ai/library).
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### 5. Run
```bash
uv run main.py
```

## ðŸ“š Learning Goals

This repository is intended for practice and learning purposes only (not production).
Itâ€™s focused on understanding how the components of a simple RAG system connect:

- Load data (PDF/text)
- Create embeddings with Hugging Face
- Store and retrieve with pgvector
- Generate answers with Ollama or OpenAI through LangChain
